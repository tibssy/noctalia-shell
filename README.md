Noctalia
===

A lightweight Wayland shell and bar built directly on Wayland + OpenGL ES, with no Qt or GTK dependency.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Noctalia v5 is in early/alpha development. Expect breaking configuration and behavior changes while the project is still taking shape.

Vendored dependencies, with no system package needed: `Wuffs`, `tomlplusplus`,
`nlohmann/json`, `Luau`, `dr_wav`, `fzy`, `stb_image_resize2`, and Material Color Utilities.

System packages required beyond the Wayland/GL stack: `libwebp` handles WebP decoding and thumbnail encoding. Wuffs
handles the other supported raster image formats. `libqalculate` powers the launcher calculator (arithmetic, unit and
currency conversion).

Polkit agent support requires development files that provide the `polkit-agent-1` and `polkit-gobject-1` pkg-config
modules. Some distros ship these in the runtime `polkit` package, while split-package distros use names such as
`polkit-devel`, `polkit-dev`, or `libpolkit-agent-1-dev` / `libpolkit-gobject-1-dev`.

`jemalloc` is recommended but optional. It reduces memory fragmentation in long-running sessions, and on glibc systems
it is used automatically when detected. Use Meson's `-Djemalloc=enabled` or `-Djemalloc=disabled` option to require or
disable it explicitly.

Sanitizer runtime packages are only needed for ASan/UBSan builds configured with `just configure asan`.

The sources are built as C++23, which requires GCC 13+ or Clang 16+. Current rolling and recent stable distros (Arch,
Fedora 38+, Debian 13, Ubuntu 24.04+) ship a new enough compiler by default. On Debian 12 "bookworm" install `g++-13`
and point Meson at it (e.g. `CXX=g++-13 just configure`).

## Building and installing

Requires [just](https://github.com/casey/just) and [meson](https://mesonbuild.com/).

#### Release build
```sh
# Optimized release build in build-release/
just configure release
just build release

# Install the selected build mode. This does not build or reconfigure.
sudo just install release
```

Pass a prefix to `configure` to install somewhere other than `/usr/local`:

```sh
just configure release "$HOME/.local"
just build release
just install release
```

To remove files installed from a build directory, run `just uninstall release`. The `install` and `uninstall` recipes
require an explicit build mode so debug builds are not installed by accident.

#### Debug build
```sh
# Debug build in build-debug/ for local development and troubleshooting.
just configure
just build

# Test your local debug build with
just run
```

Meson installs the binary and shipped assets using the normal prefix layout:

```text
/usr/local/bin/noctalia
/usr/local/share/noctalia/assets/...
```

Noctalia needs the shipped `assets/` tree at runtime. Copying only the `noctalia` binary is not enough.

Portable bundle layouts are also supported:

```text
bundle/
  noctalia
  assets/
```

```text
bundle/
  bin/noctalia
  share/noctalia/assets/
```

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#runtime-assets) for the full runtime asset lookup order.

## Configuration

Noctalia has two configuration layers:

- Declarative user config lives in `$NOCTALIA_CONFIG_HOME/noctalia/`, `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/noctalia/`, or
  `~/.config/noctalia/`.
  Noctalia reads every `*.toml` file in that directory, sorted alphabetically, and deep-merges them into one config.
  A single `config.toml` is the simplest setup, but splitting config into files such as `bar.toml`, `theme.toml`,
  or `widgets.toml` is also supported.
- GUI-managed overrides live in `$NOCTALIA_STATE_HOME/noctalia/settings.toml`,
  `$XDG_STATE_HOME/noctalia/settings.toml`, or `~/.local/state/noctalia/settings.toml`. This file is written by
  Noctalia itself for settings changed through the UI, IPC-backed controls, setup flows, and other runtime actions
  that need persistence.

Noctalia also keeps internal UI/runtime state in `$NOCTALIA_STATE_HOME/noctalia/state.toml`,
`$XDG_STATE_HOME/noctalia/state.toml`, or `~/.local/state/noctalia/state.toml`. This is app-owned state, not a
configuration layer, and it is not merged into the active config.

`NOCTALIA_CONFIG_HOME` and `NOCTALIA_STATE_HOME` are Noctalia-specific overrides with the same "home root" semantics
as the XDG variables. For example, `NOCTALIA_CONFIG_HOME=/tmp/profile` loads config from
`/tmp/profile/noctalia/`. Prefer these variables over overriding `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` when launching Noctalia from a
session, because applications started through Noctalia's launcher inherit the shell environment.

Load order is built-in defaults first, then declarative config files, then `settings.toml`.
Because the override file is applied last, GUI overrides win over matching values in `config.toml`.

Use the declarative config directory for hand-authored, dotfile-managed configuration. Treat `settings.toml` as an
app-managed override layer: inspect or delete it when you want to understand or clear GUI changes, but do not rely on
it as the primary place for curated config. Treat `state.toml` as disposable app state: inspect it when debugging UI
state, or delete it to reset remembered UI state. Keeping these app-managed files outside `~/.config` also allows the
GUI to save changes when the config directory is read-only, such as on NixOS.

Both layers are watched for changes and hot-reloaded. If neither declarative config nor state overrides exist,
Noctalia falls back to built-in defaults in code.

A ready-to-use starting config with all defaults is at [example.toml](example.toml). The full configuration reference
lives in the [documentation site](https://docs.noctalia.dev/v5/).
